# Music and Mental Health
This repository contains the details about a study I have done on the topic "A Study on Music Listening Habits and Mental Health Conditions." This project was done using Python.

# Abstract
Mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are becoming more common and affect many people. These conditions can be mild or severe, requiring different treatment approaches. One treatment that has gained attention is music therapy, particularly active listening to music, which has been linked to positive mental health outcomes. Previous research suggests that listening to music can reduce symptoms and improve well-being.

This study aims to explore the potential connections between music listening habits and the mentioned mental health conditions. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, I sought to find specific music listening behaviors that correlate with the severity and presence of these mental health issues. The analysis revealed several interesting relationships, indicating that certain listening habits might be linked to changes in mental health status.

To further investigate these findings, we developed and trained a predictive model to classify mental health status based on individualsâ€™ music listening habits. While the model was able to accurately identify certain classes for specific conditions, its overall performance was not optimal. This highlights the complexity of predicting mental health status solely based on music listening habits.

The results of this study show the potential of music listening habits as indicators of mental health status but also stress the need for more advanced and refined predictive models. Future research should focus on including additional variables and using more advanced analytical techniques to improve the predictive power of such models. This study adds to the growing evidence on the link between music therapy and mental health, offering valuable insights for both clinical practice and future research.
